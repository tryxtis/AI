# Intelligent Personal Shopping Assistant

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Description: Develop an AI-based personal shopping assistant that can assist users in finding products they need based on their preferences, budget, and shopping history. The system could use machine learning algorithms to understand user behavior and offer recommendations accordingly. The system could also integrate with e-commerce websites and offer real-time price comparisons, notify users of deals or discounts, and provide personalized shopping experiences. Users could interact with the assistant using natural language processing (NLP) and voice commands, making the system accessible and user-friendly.




## Background

Online shopping has become increasingly popular in recent years, and consumers are often overwhelmed by the vast amount of products available on e-commerce websites. Many users spend a significant amount of time browsing products, comparing prices, and reading reviews to find the right product that meets their needs and budget. This process can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when users are not sure what they are looking for.

Moreover, the abundance of choice can lead to decision fatigue, making it difficult for users to make a purchase decision. Studies have shown that too much choice can lead to lower satisfaction with the chosen product and a decreased likelihood of making a purchase. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of choice.

The Intelligent Personal Shopping Assistant aims to solve these problems by providing users with a personalized shopping experience. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the system can offer relevant product recommendations and filter out irrelevant products, reducing decision fatigue. The system can also provide real-time price comparisons, helping users find the best deal for their budget.

Overall, the project aims to simplify the online shopping experience, save users time and money, and improve customer satisfaction.

## How is it used?
1. User Registration: Users would first need to register with the Intelligent Personal Shopping Assistant system, providing basic information such as their name, email address, and shopping preferences.

2. Product Search: When a user wants to search for a product, they would interact with the system using natural language processing (NLP) or voice commands, such as "find me a new pair of running shoes." The system would then use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's query and offer relevant product recommendations.

3. Product Recommendations: The system would use recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to offer personalized product recommendations based on the user's shopping history, preferences, and budget. The system could also take into account other factors such as the user's location, time of day, and current promotions.

4. Real-time Price Comparison: The system could integrate with e-commerce websites and offer real-time price comparisons, allowing users to find the best deal for their budget. The system could also notify users of deals or discounts available for the product they are interested in.

5. Product Filtering: The system could also filter out irrelevant products based on the user's preferences, such as brand, color, size, and price range. This could help reduce decision fatigue and improve the user's shopping experience.

6. Purchase and Delivery: Once the user has selected a product, they could purchase it directly through the system or be redirected to the e-commerce website. The system could also provide delivery tracking and updates, ensuring that the user receives the product on time.

Overall, the Intelligent Personal Shopping Assistant would provide users with a personalized and user-friendly shopping experience, simplifying the online shopping process and improving customer satisfaction.

## Data sources and AI methods
1. User Data: The system would need to gather data on user preferences, shopping history, and behavior. This could include data such as the user's location, search history, purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographics.

2. Product Data: The system would need to access product data from e-commerce websites, such as product descriptions, images, prices, reviews, and ratings. The system could also use data such as product categories, brand, and availability to filter out irrelevant products.

3. Price Comparison Data: The system would need to access real-time pricing information from various e-commerce websites to provide users with accurate price comparisons.

4. Promotions and Deals Data: The system could access data on current promotions and deals available on e-commerce websites to notify users of discounts and promotions.

To collect this data, the system could use a variety of techniques such as web scraping, APIs, and data feeds from e-commerce websites. Additionally, the system could use user feedback and ratings to improve the quality of the recommendations over time. It's important to ensure that the data is collected and used ethically and in compliance with data privacy regulations.
